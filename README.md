# ANND
ANND (ANN's for Dummies) is a simple code/library to help (me, and hopefully others) understand the implementation of ANN's 
by making the code behind more accessible and readable (still working on it!). 

As of now, this repo simply follows my understanding of how ANN's work and check if my ideas of putting it in code are correct.
